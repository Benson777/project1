		<p> My name is Benjamin Wilson I am a student here at OBT stand's for Opprtunities for a better tomorrow.

			<p>I'm Learning how to code and web design. Learning How to code and web design is something I always wanted to do it ever since I was young. I was really into computers and wanted to learn how they worked. First I started off using Khan academy.learning simple codes like (h1) and (p) or (br) (li) (oi), however I started searching around for other sites and stumble across a site called Code academy and I learn lot about c++ and html.Then two years later Kingsborough college sent me an email to a place called Obt. Which is a great place to learn coding and webdesign. They help you in areas with learing code like HTML BASH CSS and Java and also design on photoshop.I recommended to anyone that want to learn coding and web design also the site I mention previously Khan and code are really good to use and also solo learn. It is a free app that is very good to use.

			<p>I went to a community college called Kingborough, during my time there I major in graphic design for one year. Im really good at it I know how to design images and how to change the color contant of a photo. The reason why I wanted to choose graphic design as my major was that I really liked how videos games were design and how the movies were design and how the art and color were animated and that spark an intrust in me want to learn photo shop and animations.I took class in kingsbrough trying to master photoshop and improve my art skills.I really like modern cartoons like spongbob adverture time and litte bit of gumball.My favorite action pack movies is The Bourne identity Underworld and thor ragnarok really great movies.I also like Disney movies like Monters Ink, Toy story, ratatouille and many others that really inspire me to wanna learn how to photo shop and animate.Also Kingsboroug is a great college with alot of opportunities it's a two year college. </p>
